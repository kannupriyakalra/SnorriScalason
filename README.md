### Next time
 - Set up a DB with postgres / skunk with a single table for comments.  
 - Goal: Have a comment box displayed on screen
 - Goodreads style.
 - Get a book with a given id
    - Filter books by fields?
    - Have those fields as query parameters?

  - Set a target: We're going all into web development! Plus DBs. 
  - Choose libs for DB: postgresql / skunk, UI: Tyrian
  - Set up testcontainers: add integration module, check if postgres image is up and running 
  - Wrote a test with ScalaTest.
  - The testcontainers docs are out of date.
  - Learned how to troubleshoot docker containers:
    - Looking at Docker desktop to see running containers.
