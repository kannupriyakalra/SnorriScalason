ScalaBridge Project - mentored by Zainab Ali & Noel Welsh

### Next time

- Use the updated version of krop with updates Noel demonstrated
- Get a book with a given id
  - Filter books by fields?
  - Have those fields as query parameters?


### Jan 25, 2024

- Get a book with a given id
  - Created `getBookById` route

- Went through PRs and merged them.
- Updated the krop version to ``0.6.0`.
- Run and call the `echo`.
